# Agency-X---Alex-and-Lucas

You will create a responsive mock SPA (single-page application) and change its
content referencing a JavaScript object. This is a team project - one designer, one
developer. The agency name is up to you and what your agency does is ALSO up
to you - it’s wide open creatively. In other words you’re not restricted to your current
field of study - if you want to be aerospace engineers or private investigators, then
go for it!
